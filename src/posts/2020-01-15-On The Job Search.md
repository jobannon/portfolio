> You could learn this tool.  You could apply for this job.  You could do this *thing.*  Or that thing.  Or this...

Managing your time when your time is unlimited is the great irony of job searching.  Learning the self-discipline to manage your time was one lesson I thought I had down.  With a BA and several well-known companies on my resume, I thought I knew the game.  Turns out, every player can learn new moves.  This is what I learned in an extended job search and what works for me.  Your mileage may vary.  But if you are struggling in your own job search party, I would encourage you to try a few of these out!

### Start Motivated

I used to start my day with a haphazard review of the news (read: doom-scrolling), coffee, and toast.  While this may be effective for *just* starting my day,  It was not effective for *launching* it.  I now write a list of daily affirmations, setup a loose daily agenda, embrace gratitude and make a point of reaching out to the folks who matter most in my life.  

The difference is palpable.  I still mess up - spend too much time on YouTube cat videos, for instance.  But largely I am in the right frame of mind to *practice* the art of job search.  Yes, that is right - the job search is a *practice*, not an activity.   

### Job Development As A Practice

Just like programming, finding a job that suits your tastes especially as a Junior with limited career capital (I am looking at you - Cal Newport, *So Good They Can't Ignore You*) is something you need to aim, fire, and repeat.  My first *code* application (written in BASIC) was a lovely dumpster fire and likewise, my first *job* applications were the same.  The point is not to get it right the first time, but to improve your aim with time.  This is best done with a daily agenda in mind.

### Set an Agenda

In the past, I might spin up my computer, log on to LinkedIn, and rub my hands together hoping to make something happen.  I have found much more success, however, in dividing my day into three buckets - *AM, PM, EVE*.   That's it.  My goal is to have one or two activities in each bucket.  A sample activity might be as simple as *Code Challenge (ùì≤).*  Crossing off an activity is immensely satisfying and grounds me in my motivation.

What is the ùì≤ you say?  Each activity I write gets assigned a ùì≤, ùìπ, or ‚ÑØ rating.  I, for investment.  I am investing in my career development to land a job.  P for productive.  This is strictly for job applications, job interviews, and thank you notes sent.  My grandma's phone call to say good night doesn't count!  E is everything else.  By holding myself accountable in this way, I can see when I let too much fear of putting myself out there (lots of I), or lack of focus (too much E) run my job search and right the ship!  

### Let the good times flow

Just like setting a good agenda is important, your tone and a general sense of self will be revealed as you write cover letters.  To counteract any feelings of non-accomplishment (despite my agenda list crossing off), I practice writing out daily affirmations.  Simple things that remind me of who I am and what I have set up to accomplish.  The job search can also be discouraging and disparaging - I counter that with a list of gratitudes.  There is a lot to be grateful for as I pursue a career I love, relying on supportive family and friends for the journey.

### Get off that island

Finally, I find the job search to be isolating.  From the impersonal initial interviews, awkward networking, and semi-targeted scrolling looking for a job that fits, it can be a bit daunting.  To counteract, I reach out to two people a day.  It could be something simple like - "Hi.  It's been 8 weeks since..."  If you think about it, pre-covid and in person, this might be a natural function of your life; drinks with old colleagues and morning coffee and donuts with new ones.  In a remote-first world, we must leave ourselves simple reminders to connect with those we care about.

### There you have it.

This my routine.  It does evolve, but not constantly.  The best advice that I have been given is - stick with something and stay awhile (*thanks Jim Rohn!*).  There are things I might change in the future, but for the magic to work, sometimes you have to let it unfold.  Otherwise, you end up with a flattened dough-cake and not a souffl√©!  

### Giving Credit

**  I owe a debt of gratitude to "Ninja Selling" by Larry Kendall and the aggregated works of Jim Rohn for the ideas for this routine.  Many things were adapted for my context as a software developer creating his next opportunity, but the lessons taught by both were invaluable.*
